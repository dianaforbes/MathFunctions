# MathFunctions
This repository contains an example of 3 math functions and the corresponding unit tests that verify how the functions will perform, if 
the argument x equals to 0.
The code not only demonstrates the ease with which math functions may be performed on Java, but also the importance 
of running Unit tests to ensure the integrity of the system.
In particular, the 3rd unit test demonstrates that the system would not perform the function and fail, if the argument x equals 0,
as we are unable to perform a division.
Thus, it is absolutely essential to run unit tests, even on the smallest components of the software to make the process agile and
detect the potential software bugs early on, allowing time for safe refactoring.
